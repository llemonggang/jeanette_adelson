        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><img id="antlers" src="./images/antlers.png" alt="Antlers" />
          A spunky creative with an analytical problem. I love beating those obstacles! Give me a stack of hay and tell me to find the needle - then ask to me to put the hay in an array and sort it by length. I also have a long history of managing and serving people. When given a challenge, I immediately begin to break it down and list by order of important steps, so can implement them in the most efficient fashion. Give me a deadline, and don't expect me to be sweating when it approaches - I know what needs to get done and how long it will take me to do. I'm searching for a home company to call me partner, friend, and pupil. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanette-adelson">Contact me!</a>

                 is an app to check your daily horoscope. Using an API to pull in your daily, love, wellness, and career horoscopes, it's a fun way to stay up-to-date with the cosmos. There's also information about the moon phases, sunrise, and sunset times based on your current location. The App uses fun icons, reflected on an Astronomy Picture of the Day, straight from NASA. Future plans include adding information about planets and how they affect your horoscope, information about how different zodiac signs generally relate to each other, and exciting news related to the cosmos!

                 was a coding challenge I was given where I was asked to build a site based on a UX Design. I was given a Markdown file, the images, and an image displaying the desired font sizes and colors. I used HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript to build it. The completion of this test gained me an interview with this company.

                <h1>Villa Homes</h1></a>
                 is a site I am building for a construction business based out of Kerrville, Tx. I was only given a list of service that they offer and was told to do the rest. This was my first opportunity to also design a site for a client, which was an exciting endeavor! The site is still under <i> construction </i> (pun intended), but the link shows the design I built on <a href="https://canva.com">Canva,</a> which I was able to present to the client before starting to build. This helped both of us nail down the details without wasting time.

                is a collaborative project design and refined by a team of UX designers. The wireframes were deliverd to me and my team members to build in a week's time. Our focus was to produce the minimum viable product to then build on later. The focus of the site is to connect people who wish to donate food, with people who need food for their own services.

                <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1></a>
                 was my first challenge with JavaScript, and a huge lessons in writing functions, as well as learning to conceptulaize an entire project before beginning to code. Using a basic HTML template, I wrote functions using JavaScript and the JQuery library. When the page loads, Player 1 is the first player to go, and when they click an empty cell, it is marked with an "X", then the Current Player switches to Player 2. When Player 2 clicks an empty cell, it is marked with an "O", and then the Current Player switches back to one. If a player clicks a cell that has already been marked, they see an alert letting them know that the cell in question has already been taken. When either player gets three in a row, they are pronounced the winner and the game resets with the opposite player starting the game.
