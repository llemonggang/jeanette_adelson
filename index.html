          A spunky creative with an analytical problem. I love beating those obstacles! Give me a stack of hay and tell me to find the needle - then ask to me to put the hay in an array and sort it by length. I also have a long history of managing and serving people. When given a challenge, I immediately begin to break it down and list by order of important steps, so can implement them in the most efficient fashion. Give me a deadline, and don't expect me to be sweating when it approaches - I know what needs to get done and how long it will take me to do. I'm searching for a home company to call me partner, friend, and pupil. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeanette-adelson">Contact me!</a>

                Zodia is an app to check your daily horoscope. Using an API to pull in your daily, love, wellness, and career horoscopes, it's a fun way to stay up-to-date with the cosmos. There's also information about the moon phases, sunrise, and sunset times based on your current location. The App uses fun icons, reflected on an Astronomy Picture of the Day, straight from NASA. Future plans include adding information about planets and how they affect your horoscope, information about how different zodiac signs generally relate to each other, and exciting news related to the cosmos!

                  The Villa Homes website is a site I am building for a construction business based out of Kerrville, Tx. I was only given a list of service that they offer and was told to do the rest. This was my first opportunity to also design a site for a client, which was an exciting endeavor! The site is still under <i> construction </i> (pun intended), but the link shows the design I built on <a href="https://canva.com">Canva,</a> which I was able to present to the client before starting to build. This helped both of us nail down the details without wasting time building the design with code first.

                UrbanLibs is your childhood, but adult-style: Madlibs meets Urban Dictionary. A group project that generates a random sentence, then random words from urbandictionary.com and their definitions. Made with React, it's a single page application that is fun when you're not having fun. Pull it out at parties and let the silliness prevail!

                Feed512 is a collaborative project design and refined by a team of UX designers. The wireframes were deliverd to me and my team members to build in a week's time. Our focus was to produce the minimum viable product to then build on later. The focus of the site is to connect people who wish to donate food, with people who need food for their own services.

                Tic-Tac-Toe was my first challenge with Javascript, and a huge lessons in writing functions, as well as learning to conceptulaize an entire project before beginning to code. Using a basic html template, the guidlines were as follows:
                <ul id="tic-list">
                  <li>When the page loads, Player 1 (X) is the first player to go</li>

                  <li>When Player 2 clicks an empty cell, it should be marked with an "O", and Current Player should switch back to one</li>
                  <li>If a player clicks a cell that has already been marked, they should see an alert letting them know that the cell in question has already been taken</li>
